# Functions

- A grouping of code that performs a task.

1. Level of access
2. Return value
3. Function name
4. Parameters
5. Code

        public void name(int param {
            // code
        })

- To run a function we need to call it.
- Write function names using lowerCamelCase

- Parameters are values that a function can use.
- Arguments values that we need to pass to the function, values that we actually pass.
- How you place your arguments is IMPORTANT!!!
- return is the last thing that runs.

## Scope
The scope of a variable can be at the level of a class or a function.
(Inside the curly braces)
- function scope
- class scope

You can't access a variable beyond the scope of its existence.

## Built-in functions
Functions that Java made for us.
