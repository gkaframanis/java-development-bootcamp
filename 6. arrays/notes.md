# Arrays
- Store many values at the same time.

1. Place square brackets next to the type
2. Then, store many values of that type

        int[] integers = {1, 2, 3}
3. The variable does not store the array, it stores a reference that points to it.
4. You can access an element from its index.
5. You can't access an element from an index that doesn't exist! (out of bounds)
6. Always use the length property to loop through an array.

## 2D arrays
- An array that contains arrays
- Perfect for data in the form of a grid or a table
- Every row in the table it's like is its own array.

1. The type with two brackets
2. Numbers of rows in the first bracket.
3. Number of elements per row in the second bracket.
