# Variables

- Variables are written in lowerCamelCase.
- Java is strongly typed and case sensitive.

## int (small whole numbers | they a range inside + and -2 billion)

To store numbers

## String (object)

To store text. We use !!! ***double quotes*** !!!

Text + icon (the number blends into the text)

## char (primitive)

It can store only one character. We use !!! ***single quotes*** !!!
We can join String and char using the + sign.

## long (can store much larger whole numbers than int)

## double 

To store decimal numbers. You can't store decimals to int or long,  
but you can store int or long to double. Better to use double for   
math calculations 

## Operators
+, -, *, /, %, ++, --, +=. -=

- An operation between whole numbers returns a whole numbers
- An operation between decimals will preserve the decimal

## Type casting
### Casting double to int
1. The type you are casting to
2. The original value 

int integer = (int)decimal;

## Scanner (to get values from the user)
- Waits for the user to enter a value

1. The type: Scanner
2. The variable name
3. A new Scanner value

***Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);***
